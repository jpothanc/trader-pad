# Trading Pad 

## Overview

Trading Pad is a simple trading app that I'm putting together to get the hang of React with TypeScript for the front end and .NET 6.0 with gRPC and WebSockets for the back end. It's kind of a side adventure to dip my toes into React while playing around with a bit of trading simulation.
